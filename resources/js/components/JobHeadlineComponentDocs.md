 ### Project Overview

This Vue.js component is part of a job posting application. It allows users to input information about a job, including a headline, country, region, and postcode. The component uses Vue's reactivity and computed properties to validate user input and display error messages. It also uses SweetAlert2 for user feedback and Axios for submitting data to a server.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

#### 1. Importing Necessary Libraries

```javascript
import { reactive, onMounted, computed, ref, shallowRef, inject } from 'vue';
import { useQuestionnaireStore } from '../store/questionnaireStore';
import SignUp from '../components/SignUpComponent.vue';
import EmailInput from '../components/EmailInputComponent.vue'
import * as Yup from 'yup';
import axios from 'axios';
import { postcodeValidator, postcodeValidatorExistsForCountry } from 'postcode-validator';
```

This code imports the necessary Vue.js libraries and components for building the job posting form.

#### 2. Defining Reactive Data

```javascript
const jobheadlineref = ref('');
const showSecondComponent = ref(false);
const user = inject("user")
const form = reactive({
    country: '',
    region: '',
    jobHeadline: '',
    postcode: '',
});
```

The `jobheadlineref` variable is used to scroll to the job headline input field on page load. The `showSecondComponent` variable controls the display of the next component in the form. The `user` variable is injected from the parent component and contains user information if the user is logged in. The `form` object contains reactive data for the job posting form.

#### 3. Defining Computed Properties

```javascript
const validationSchema = computed(() => {
    return Yup.object().shape({
        country: Yup.string().required('Country is required'),
        region: Yup.string().required('Region is required'),
        jobHeadline: Yup.string()
            .min(20, 'Job Headline must be more than 20 characters')
            .required('Job Headline is required'),
        postcode: Yup.string()
            .nullable()
            .test('valid-postal-code', 'Invalid Postal Code', (value) => isValidPostalCode(value)),
    });
});
```

The `validationSchema` computed property defines the Yup validation schema for the
